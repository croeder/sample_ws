.        The core requirements were not met

·        Dependency Injection was not used for rules; rule instances were constructed explicitly with “new” instead of injected

·        Production code was not directly tested (CombinedRuleTest copied the RegEx definitions instead of testing AppValidator)

·        There was insufficient testing for the code provided

If I had more time to spend, I might switch from binding a single class for the rules used, AppValidator, to a list of rules directly. This would elevate the rules choice a step closer to deployment. If HK2 had a file that lists the bindings (it may) instead of a java  class, you might be able to get to a deployment-space rule selection.
