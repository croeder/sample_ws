password_validation

This is project implements a simple password validation service. It doesn't have anything to do with authenticating users. Instructions at the bottom.  Built with maven. Tested with jUnit. mvn exec:java runs a stand-alone grizzly server on localhost:8080. curlget.sh script hits it with curl. p.html is a form for use in a browser.

TODO:
- deployment jar/war, url
- source jar

Comments:
- It could be more interesting with a list/array of injections rather than an encapsulating class for a number of rules.
- I'd be interested to hear opinions about using the 412 for a failing password.

===================================================

Programming Problem

Instructions:

Write a password validation service, meant to be configurable via IoC (using dependency injection engine of your choice).  The service is meant to check a text string for compliance to any number of password validation rules.  The rules currently known are:

1.       Must consist of a mixture of lowercase letters and numerical digits only, with at least one of each.

2.       Must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.

3.       Must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence.

For any questions or clarifications, please contact Brian Heineman (Brian.Heineman@McKesson.com) 

Include all artifacts in a zip file and please let us know how many hours you spent on the programming problem. The project should include a build capability in one of the following tools, Eclipse, IntelliJ, ant, or maven. The project should be ready for insertion into a production system. Show tests for the service and any constituent classes involved in fulfillment of the service. Also, show how to access and use the service at runtime.
