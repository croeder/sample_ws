Programming Problem

Instructions:

Write a password validation service, meant to be configurable via IoC (using dependency injection engine of your choice).  The service is meant to check a text string for compliance to any number of password validation rules.  The rules currently known are:

1.       Must consist of a mixture of lowercase letters and numerical digits only, with at least one of each.

2.       Must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.

3.       Must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence.

For any questions or clarifications, please contact Brian Heineman (Brian.Heineman@McKesson.com) 

Include all artifacts in a zip file and please let us know how many hours you spent on the programming problem. The project should include a build capability in one of the following tools, Eclipse, IntelliJ, ant, or maven. The project should be ready for insertion into a production system. Show tests for the service and any constituent classes involved in fulfillment of the service. Also, show how to access and use the service at runtime.
